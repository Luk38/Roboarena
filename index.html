    <h2>Sprint 1 Results</h2>
    <p>The first Sprint included the basic Setup to start our Programming Journey</p>
    <p>- All group members installed Python and Pygame</p>
    <p>- We set up our Project repository and invited all members and tutors (Marco, Lukas)</p>
    <p>- We added a flake8 test as our first GitHub action (Edwin)</p>
    <p>- We created a basic pygame template to begin with (Lukas) </p>

    <p>- We added key (Marco) and mouse (Lukas) event handlers</p>
    <p>- We added a start button to switch from menu to game state (Edwin)</p>

    <h2>Sprint 2 Results</h2>
    <p>In the second Sprint we had to draft what our game could look like and start with the basic game functions</p>
    <p>- Edwin showed his idea and all group members agreed on that</p>
    <p>- We created sketches of what the game could look like (Edwin)</p>
    <p>- We created a arena class and added an arena object into our game (Edwin)</p>
    <p>- We created a BasicRobot class and added an object of this class for our first Robot (without the direction of the object beeing shown) (Lukas)</p>
    <p>- We added the movement of our first Robot object through key handlers, so you can control the robot by pressing w, a, s, d (Marco)</p>

    <h2>Sprint 3 Results</h2>
    <p>For the third Sprint our goal was to extend our robot class and to make new levels easier to add</p>
    <p>-We created levels as text files to read them from hard disc [Edwin]</p>
    <p>-We agreed on what assets to use as graphical tiles</p>
    <P>-We extended our Robot class by representing accelerations and speed and adding more Robots (foes, players) [Lukas] </P>
    <p>-We added Weapon assets to resemble first functionalities (aiming, foes targeting player) [Marco]</p>
    <p>-For our Robots assets we found a few fitting ones but didnt include them yet</p>
    <p>-To check our Code for flake8 errors we all added a flake8 extensions on our local machines</p>
