    <h2>Sprint 1 Results</h2>
    <h4>The first Sprint included the basic Setup to start our Programming Journey</h4>
    <li> All group members installed Python and Pygame</li>
    <li> We set up our Project repository and invited all members and tutors (Marco, Lukas)</li>
    <li> We added a flake8 test as our first GitHub action (Edwin)</li>
    <li> We created a basic pygame template to begin with (Lukas) </li>
    <br/><br/>

    <br/><br/>
    <li> We added key (Marco) and mouse (Lukas) event handlers</li>
    <li> We added a start button to switch from menu to game state (Edwin)</li>

    <h2>Sprint 2 Results</h2>
    <h4>In the second Sprint we had to draft what our game could look like and start with the basic game functions</h4>
    <li> Edwin showed his idea and all group members agreed on that</li>
    <li> We created sketches of what the game could look like (Edwin)</li>
    <li> We created a arena class and added an arena object into our game (Edwin)</li>
    <li> We created a BasicRobot class and added an object of this class for our first Robot (without the direction of the object beeing shown) (Lukas)</li>
    <li> We added the movement of our first Robot object through key handlers, so you can control the robot by pressing w, a, s, d (Marco)</li>

    <h2>Sprint 3 Results</h2>
    <h4>For the third Sprint our goal was to extend our robot class and to make new levels easier to add</h4>
    <li> We created levels as text files to read them from hard disc [Edwin]</li>
    <li> We agreed on what assets to use as graphical tiles</li>
    <li> We extended our Robot class by representing accelerations and speed and adding more Robots (foes, players) [Lukas] </li>
    <li> We added Weapon assets to resemble first functionalities (aiming, foes targeting player) [Marco]</li>
    <li> For our Robots assets we found a few fitting ones but didnt include them yet</li>
    <li> To check our Code for flake8 errors we all added a flake8 extensions on our local machines</li>

    <h2>Sprint 4 Results</h2>
    <h4>For the fourth Sprint we had to start discussing our minimum viable Product for our Game</h4>
    <li> We opened a Github Project to add and assign to-do's and to get a better overview of our Project</li>
    <li> We created an MVP.md file that contains our minimum viable Product</li>
    <li> Edwin started working on our collision management</li>
    <li> Marco refined our code and added TypeHints</li>
    <li> Marco started working on Character and foe designs</li>
    <li> Lukas created a new design for our menu</li>
    <li> Lukas added new buttons to the menu for further use (different states)</li>

    <h2>Sprint 5 Results</h2>
    <h4>For the fitht Sprint we wanted to make Collision of the player and the Map possible and create new Maps to add to the Game</h4>
    <li> We opened Created the Issue in our Github Project and assigned ourselves</li>
    <li> Edwin continued working on collisions</li>
    <li> Lukas created a new Player class to make everything sprite Classes, because Sprite Classes have some integrated functions to make things easier</li>
    <li> Lukas finished the collision by using sprite groups and detecting any collision between the player and the collision sprites (on the map)</li>
    <li> Marco Created 2 new maps in Tiled. With Tiled we can easily created more maps</li>

    <br/><br/>
    <li> Lukas loaded the Tiled files into our game by using pytmx.</li>
    <li> Marco changed our "camera" movement, so that the player is always the center of the screen and the camera "follows" him on the map</li>

    <h2>Sprint 6 Results</h2>
    <h4> For this sprint we further worked on our to-do's of the github Projects Table</h4>
    <p>Marco completed the implementation of enemy entities</p>
