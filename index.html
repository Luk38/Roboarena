    <h2>Sprint 1 Results</h2>
    <p>The first Sprint included the basic Setup to start our Programming Journey</p>
    <p>- All group members installed Python and Pygame</p>
    <p>- We set up our Project repository and invited all members and tutors (Marco, Lukas)</p>
    <p>- We added a flake8 test as our first GitHub action (Edwin)</p>
    <p>- We created a basic pygame template to begin with (Lukas) </p>
    <img src="img/example_PR.png" height="250">
    <p>- We added key (Marco) and mouse (Lukas) event handlers</p>
    <p>- We added a start button to switch from menu to game state (Edwin)</p>

    <h2>Sprint 2 Results</h2>
    <p>In the second Sprint we had to draft what our game could look like and start with the basic game functions</p>
    <p>- Edwin showed his idea and all group members agreed on that</p>
    <p>- We created sketches of what the game could look like (Edwin)</p>
    <p>- We created a arena class and added an arena object into our game (Edwin)</p>
    <p>- We created a BasicRobot class and added an object of this class for our first Robot (without the direction of the object beeing shown) (Lukas)</p>
    <p>- We added the movement of our first Robot object through key handlers, so you can control the robot by pressing w, a, s, d (Marco)</p>

    <h2>Sprint 3 Results</h2>
    <p>For the third Sprint our goal was to extend our robot class and to make new levels easier to add</p>
    <p>-We created levels as text files to read them from hard disc [Edwin]</p>
    <p>-We agreed on what assets to use as graphical tiles</p>
    <P>-We extended our Robot class by representing accelerations and speed and adding more Robots (foes, players) [Lukas] </P>
    <p>-We added Weapon assets to resemble first functionalities (aiming, foes targeting player) [Marco]</p>
    <p>-For our Robots assets we found a few fitting ones but didnt include them yet</p>
    <p>-To check our Code for flake8 errors we all added a flake8 extensions on our local machines</p>

    <h2>Sprint 4 Results</h2>
    <p>For the fourth Sprint we had to start discussing our minimum viable Product for our Game</p>
    <p>-We opened a Github Project to add and assign to-do's and to get a better overview of our Project</p>
    <p>-We created an MVP.md file that contains our minimum viable Product</p>
    <p>-Edwin started working on our collision management</p>
    <P>-Marco refined our code and added TypeHints</P>
    <P>-Marco started working on Character and foe designs</P>
    <p>-Lukas created a new design for our menu</p>
    <p>-Lukas added new buttons to the menu for further use (different states)</p>

    <h2>Sprint 5 Results</h2>
    <p>For the fitht Sprint we wanted to make Collision of the player and the Map possible and create new Maps to add to the Game</p>
    <p>-We opened Created the Issue in our Github Project and assigned ourselves</p>
    <p>-Edwin continued working on collisions</p>
    <p>-Lukas created a new Player class to make everything sprite Classes, because Sprite Classes have some integrated functions to make things easier</p>
    <P>-Lukas finished the collision by using sprite groups and detecting any collision between the player and the collision sprites (on the map)</P>
    <P>-Marco Created 2 new maps in Tiled. With Tiled we can easily created more maps</P>

    <img src="img/Sprint5_Wasteland.png" height="250"> 
    <p>-Lukas loaded the Tiled files into our game by using pytmx.</p>
    <p>-Marco changed our "camera" movement, so that the player is always the center of the screen and the camera "follows" him on the map</p>
    <img src="img/sprint5_Game.png" height="250">
    <p>-Edwin created a new image for our Player Robot</p>
